I haven't really spoken about this with anyone. It was an isolated incident, and I can't stop replaying the encounter over and over in my head, and it terrifies me everytime. I have to apologize in advance is the formatting is off, I'm posting from my phone while I avoid doing any work at the office.

This last year has been soul-crushing for a lot of reasons. Work has been such a shit show and my role has changed so drastically due to the pandemic that it feels like a shell of its former self. The pivots and shifting my responsibilities have taken have made me resent going to the office, and unfortunately, that resentment has followed me home. Things between my girlfriend and I are...rocky. We don't yell at each other or anything, but there's palpable tension when we watch TV together, and we both know we're in somewhat of a rut, but haven't really talked about it. So after months of feeling this way, day in day out, I became apathetic to it all. Work, home, sleep, repeat was kinda the motto. Time just passed and I stood still, hating my job and uncomfortable at home, I became numb. Please don't misconstrue my apathy however as a sign that I don't love my girlfriend, because I do. I truly do. I want to make it out of this rut with her, but I just can't find the energy to fight for it right now.

About a month ago, she turned to me in bed and bludgeoned me over the head and out of my usual daze with a hammer in the form of a question: "Do you wanna have a baby?". Normally, I'd say something like "In the middle of the pandemic?" or "Can we even afford it at this point in our lives?". But there was something in her eyes as she asked that I hadn't seen in a long time when she asked the question: Hope. I might've projected these feelings onto her, I'm not sure, but I could see a glimmer of hope, twinkle in her green eyes. I said yes, and for the first time in a long time, I felt alive, I felt joy. We kissed, we hugged, we cuddled and we got to work trying to have a baby. Looking back at this moment now, I still smile and my heart still flutters.

It became way easier to get out of bed and drag my ass to work after that night. I felt like I was working towards something, I couldn't wait for the days to end so I can get home to my girlfriend. The office is a 15 minute walk from my condo, but I was so excited to get home everyday, I even started to cut through a park in the afternoons to reduce the time it took to get home. Happiness, after such a shit year, was finally mine. And then it got all fucked last tuesday.

I was walking through the park to get home when I noticed a young girl, no older than 8, sitting alone on the bench, with nobody around. Now, I gotta be honest, I was apprehensive about approaching her because I'm a 30 year old man and approaching a child in the park just sends all the wrong messages, and, selfishlessly, I wanted to go home and be with my girlfriend. Trying to see if this girl was alone could only take up more of my time than I was willing to give. I kept walking, hating myself more and more with everystep until I heard "Hey mister! Mister!" Fuck. I turned around to face her. The following is the conversation that took place.

**Me**: Hi! Is everything alright?
**LG(Little Girl)**: Not really, I ran away, but now I'm scared and I don't know how to get back home
**Me**: Oh gosh, well, I can call the police and they can come help you get home and call your parents.
**LG**: Okay, but can you wait with me?
**Me**: Sure.

So I sit down on the bench with her, call the local police station and they say they'll send a unit over shortly.

**Me**: So what's your name?
**LG**: I don't wanna tell you, daddy said I shouldn't tell strangers my name.
**Me**: Well you shouldn't be talking to strangers, period. 

The girl looked up at me and her eyes started to glisten. Same way my girlfriend does when she "puppy dogs" me with the same green eyes. Shit, great, the girl's scared and i'm making her rethink the decision to ask me for help by being an asshole.

**Me**: look, don't worry about it, I don't need your name, but the police will, so you gotta tell them okay.
**LG**: *nods*
**Me**: So why'd you run away?
**LG**: My mommy hurts me.
**Me**: What do you mean??
**LG**: When daddy's not home, Mommy hurts me. She hits me and makes me stay underwater for a long time. She told me if I ever tell my daddy, she'll start hurting him too.
**Me**: You have to tell this to police when they get here okay, this is serious.
**LG**: I can't, it'll make mommy angry. I just want her to go away, I don't want her to hurt anyone. Daddy said he'd protect me, but he's always working.
**Me**: The Police can protect you, you need to stop this.
**LG**: Why can't you protect me, Daddy?

She turned to me slowly, and the right side of her face just started to bruise. Before I could say anything, the bruised grew darker and then, in one swift motion, her entire right side, caved inward, letting out a sickening crunch of bone. It's the last thing I remember.

I woke up to cops telling me I couldn't sleep in the park. They asked me if I was okay, because I was obviously antsy, and asked them if they saw a little girl here. They said there was nobody here when they showed up, and that somebody called about a guy passed out in the park. They gave me a ticket and told me to get home. I checked my phone, obviously shaken by all of this and saw that I had 7 missed calls from my girlfriend and texts asking where I was, and that I never even called the cops. I was an hour and a half late. After calling her and lying that I got held up at the office. I got home finally, and ny girlfriend wasn't as annoyed as I thought she would be. Once I settled in, still trying to process what the fuck just happened. My girlfriend sat down next to me, kissed me and smiled.

"I'm Pregnant."
